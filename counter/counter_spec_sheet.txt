Counter DUT Specification Sheet
1. DUT Name: Counter

2. Description:

This document specifies the functional interface of a counter DUT (Design Under Test). The DUT implements an 8-bit counter with reset and load functionalities.

3. Ports:

Port Name	    Description	                            Data Type	Direction
i_inf.clk	    Clock signal	                            bit	        Input
i_inf.rst	    Reset signal (active low)	                bit	        Input
i_inf.load	    Load enable signal	                        bit         Input
i_inf.data_in	Data to be loaded (when load is enabled)	bit [7:0]   Input
i_inf.count	    Counter output (current count value)	    bit [7:0]	Output


4. Functional Behavior:

Clock (i_inf.clk): The counter increments or loads on the positive edge of the clock when enabled.
Reset (i_inf.rst): An active low reset signal initializes the counter to 0 on the negative edge.
Load (i_inf.load): When asserted high along with a valid data value on i_inf.data_in, the counter is loaded with the provided data on the positive edge of the clock.
Count Output (i_inf.count): This output represents the current count value of the counter, ranging from 0 to 255 (due to 8-bit width).
5. Assumptions and Restrictions:

The counter operates on the positive edge of the clock.
The reset and load operations are not synchronized with the clock. It's assumed that these signals don't glitch or change too rapidly to cause unintended behavior.
The counter does not perform any overflow or underflow detection.
6. Additional Notes:

This specification sheet focuses on the functional interface. The internal implementation details of the counter are not included.
Users of this DUT should ensure that the reset and load signals are used appropriately to avoid unexpected behavior.
This spec sheet provides a clear description of the counter DUT's functionality, 
ports, and limitations. It can be used for test case development, 
integration with other verification components, 
and communication between design and verification teams.
