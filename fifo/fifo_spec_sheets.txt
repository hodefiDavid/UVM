Here's a specification sheet for the given FIFO (First-In, First-Out) buffer module written in Verilog:

## FIFO Specification Sheet

### Module Overview

The `fifo` module is a parameterized FIFO buffer, which allows for temporary storage and retrieval of data in a first-in, first-out manner. The module is parameterizable in terms of address width (`AWIDTH`) and data width (`DWIDTH`).

### Parameter Declarations

- **AWIDTH**: Address width (default value: 4)
- **DWIDTH**: Data width (default value: 4)

The fifo queue size is 16; //2 ** AWIDTH

### Port Declarations

- **Inputs**:
  - `clk`: Clock signal.
  - `rst`: Reset signal (active high).
  - `write_en`: Write enable signal (active high).
  - `read_en`: Read enable signal (active high).
  - `data_in`: Data input bus of width `DWIDTH`.

- **Outputs**:
  - `full`: Full flag, indicates if the FIFO is full (active high).
  - `empty`: Empty flag, indicates if the FIFO is empty (active high).
  - `data_out`: Data output bus of width `DWIDTH`, registered output.

### Internal Variable Declarations

- **Local Parameters**:
  - `DEPTH`: Depth of the FIFO memory, calculated as `2^AWIDTH`.

### Functional Description

- **Resewri Behavior**: On a reset (`rst`)  full = 0, empty =1

- **Write Operation**: When `write_en` is asserted and the FIFO is not full, the data from `data_in` is written to the memory.

- **Read Operation**: When `read_en` is asserted and the FIFO is not empty, pop the first data;

- **Empty Flag (`empty`)**: as described above

- **Full Flag (`full`)**: as described above

### Timing Diagram Example

Below is an example timing diagram demonstrating typical read and write operations with a FIFO:

```
clk        : |‾‾‾|__|‾‾‾|__|‾‾‾|__|‾‾‾|__|‾‾‾|__|‾‾‾|__|
rst        : |‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|________|
write_en   : |____|‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|______________________|‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|
read_en    : |________________|‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|_____________________|
data_in    : |____|  A  |____|  B  |____|  C  |____|  D  |____|  E  |
data_out   : |____|_____|____|  A  |____|  B  |____|  C  |____|____|
empty      : |‾‾‾|___________|‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾|______________|‾‾‾|
full       : |____|___________|_____________________|_________|____|
```

In this example:
- Data `A` is written to the FIFO when `write_en` is high.
- Data `A` is read from the FIFO when `read_en` is high.
- The `empty` flag is high initially and becomes low after the first write.
- The `full` flag becomes high when the FIFO is full and resets when data is read.

### Important Notes

- The FIFO does not handle simultaneous read and write operations. The logic should be designed to avoid asserting both `read_en` and `write_en` at the same time, unless additional handling is implemented.

This specification sheet should provide a clear overview of the FIFO module's functionality, parameters, and typical usage within a digital system.
